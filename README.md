## Data Augmentation Process
We use the method indicated in the article of Eigen et al. 

We augment the training data with random online transformations: 

- `Scale`: Input and target images are scaled by `s` in [1, 1.5], and the depths are divided by `s`. 
- `Rotation`: Input and target are rotated by `s` in [âˆ’5, 5] degrees. 
- `Translation`: Input and target are randomly cropped to the sizes we need. 
- `Color`: Input values are multiplied globally by a random RGB value `c` in [0.8, 1.2]. 
- `Flips`: Input and target are horizontally flipped with 0.5 probability. 


to reduce the effect of meaningless candidates in sky regions, we used a classifier to label sky pixels and for the depth of the corresponding superpixels to take the value (0, 0, 1, 80).
